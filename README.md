# Caesar_Cipher_Function
Ceasar Cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques.  It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

# To test the Caeser Cipher
1. The word or text you want to encrypt
2. calling the Caesar_Cipher function

new_word = 'I love Electrical/Electronics Engineering'

a_variable = cipher(new_word,15)  #encrypting

cipher(a_variable,-15) #decrypting
